Calculations
===============================================================================

Here are the required imports again. You do not need to repeat them if you are
still in the same python session.

.. ipython:: python

    from prody import *
    from pylab import *
    ion()


Loading a structure and applying the anisotropic network model
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, we parse a structure that we want to analyse with PRS.
For this tutorial, we will fetch the near-intact full length AMPAR
structure 3kg2 from the PDB. We import a subset containing the calpha
atoms, which we will use in downstream steps.

.. ipython:: python

    ampar_ca = parsePDB('3kg2', subset='ca')


Next, create an ANM instance and calculate modes from which the covariance
matrix can be calculated. We could ask for all modes rather than the default subset
of the first 20 global modes. We could alternatively apply the PRS to another
model from which a covariance matrix could be derived such as PCA, GNM or an
MD simulation.

.. ipython:: python

    anm_ampar = ANM('AMPAR 3kg2')
    anm_ampar.buildHessian(ampar_ca)
    anm_ampar.calcModes()


Showing the PRS matrix with effectiveness and sensitivity profiles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PRS matrix is then calculated from the covariance matrix from the ANM of
the AMPAR. This can be automatically carried out together with plotting
using the following code. We supply atoms to allow us to delineate residue
numbers and chains.

.. ipython:: python

    show = showPerturbResponse(anm_ampar, atoms=ampar_ca)
    @savefig 3kg2_prs.png width=4in
    plt.show()

Saving the model
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also save the ANM model in a .npz file for loading again and
write an .nmd for visualizing in the NMWiz_.
Adding *matrices=True* allows us to save the covariance matrix so we
can calculate the PRS faster in future analyses.

.. ipython:: python

    saveModel(anm_ampar, '3kg2', matrices=True)
    writeNMD('anm_3kg2.nmd', anm_ampar, ampar_ca)

The next page illustrates some more detailed analyses.
