Introduction
============

Collective Molecular Dynamics is a VMD_ plugin GUI and a Python module developed for setup and analysis of simulations described in [MG13]_.

Installation
------------

1. VMD_ 1.9.2 or later is required for using GUI. `NAMD`_ is required for
   running molecular dynamics simulations and latest version of ProDy_ is required for elastic network model calculations. Following are required for performing coMD calculations:

  * Python_ 2.7
  * NumPy_ 1.3 or later


2. Download one of the following archive files:

  * `comd_plugin_files.tgz <comd_plugin_files.tgz>`_
  * `comd_plugin_files.zip <comd_plugin_files.zip>`_


3. Extract contents of the archive and copy :file:`comd` folder to
   VMD TCL plugins directory, i.e. :file:`$VMDDIR/plugins/noarch/tcl/`.

   Then, insert following line into :file:`$VMDDIR/scripts/vmd/loadplugins.tcl`
   at line 200::

     vmd_install_extension comd comd_tk "Simulations/Collective Molecular Dynamics (CoMD)"


   If you are not sure where VMD directory is located, run :program:`vmd`, and
   type the following command line in the VMD console::

     global env; puts $env(VMDDIR)


coMD Plugin
-------------

Collective Molecular Dynamics (coMD) plugin, shown below, has a panel to
setup, collective molecular dynamics simulations:

.. figure:: ../../_static/figures/comd_setup_gui.png
   :scale: 80%

The rest of the tutorial will show you how to use this panel, and described
required inputs and outputs from analysis steps.
