Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) Analysis
===============================================================================
SAXS is an experimental technique which gives information about solution
structure of biological macromolecules. SAXS data is a 1D data of Magnitude of
Scattering Vector vs Scattering Intesity. In this tutorial, we will see how to
combine SAXS data with a known protein structure to obtain information about
solution structure of a protein. Basically, we are trying to obtain an unknown
protein conformation from a known pdb file and SAXS data by utilizing normal
modes obtained with anisotropic network model.
