            <h2><b>MechStiff</b> for Evaluating Mechanical Stiffness</h2>
            <p><b>MechStiff</b> calculates the mechanical resistance 
            to external force (uniaxial tension) applied at specific pairs of residues on the 3D structure. 

            <h4>Features</h4>
            <p><b>MechStiff</b> uses as an input the known structure modeled as an elastic network (ANM). It may be used to evaluate the 
            Mechanical Stiffness/Strength Map as a function of residue indices and effective stiffness (or force constant)
            for each residue averaged over all pairs it forms, plotted as in 2D (map) or 1D (profile) respectively,
            along with the ribbon diagrams color-coded by residue strength (TCL script directly
            uploaded to <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a>). The plots and vizualization can be used for:</p>
